# Mystery Box Puzzles

This repository hosts all of the puzzles for the Mystery Box Game. All puzzles have at least eight english language words which can be constructed from a subset the eight letters in each jumble (without repeats). Hosting the data this way is probably some kind of ToS violation, so please don&rsquo;t be a narc&mdash;if Microsoft asks, you&rsquo;ve never seen this repository before in your life. Thanksâœ¨ðŸ’–
